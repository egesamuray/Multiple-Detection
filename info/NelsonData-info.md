shots.fixed.1-401.recon.su – input data 401x401 cube with all near offsets reconstructed via EPSI

shots.fixed.1-401.mul.NO.su – the EPSI multiples

shots.fixed.1-401.prim.su – the EPSI primaries (i.e. input – multiples)

shots.fixed.1-401.srmemult.su – the SRME predicted multiples before adaptation (i.e. convolution of EPSI data with EPSI prim)

 

The latter has still wavelet uncorrected and also has time dependent scaling errors, just like SRME provides.

 

Shots are numbered 1-401 although they are constructed from reciprocity and near-offset interpolation.

First shot has source at trace1, next shot source at trace 2, …., shot 401 has shot at trace 401 (fixed spread configuration).
